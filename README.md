Make videos with GPT, ElevenLabs, and moviepy

Currently working on a frontend shortform AI-generated video sequence editor using eel.py for an HTML frontend.

Roadmap:
- ~~Make it work from code~~
- Make a frontend editor UI
- Port the UI to web accessability
- Implement security
- (Optional) Charging rates for access to content generated using _my_ API keys


Notes for me:
